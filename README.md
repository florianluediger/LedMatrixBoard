# Led Matrix Board
This is the board layout for a circuit containing two 8x8 LED matrices controlled by some MAX7219 drivers and an ESP8266 microcontroller. It is also possible to cascade multiple boards to get a wider display.

# Required parts
 - [ESP2866 development board](https://www.gearbest.com/transmitters-receivers-module/pp_366523.html?wid=21)
 - [2x MAX27XX LED drivers](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/power/display-power-control/MAX7221.html)
 - [2x 8x8 single color 60.2mm LED matrices with row cathodes and column anodes](https://www.tme.eu/de/details/lmd23088aag-101a/led-matrix-displays/wenrun/lmd23088aag-101a-01/)
 - 2x 10kOhm resistors
 - 1x 200nF ceramic capacitor
 - 1x 4.4uF electrolytic capacitor
 - a power jack
 - some sockets and headers
